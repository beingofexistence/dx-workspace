# Autostart

Autostart can be used to remember your workspace start preferences, such as the editor and workspace class, so that you don't have to make a selection on every workspace start.

## Persist workspace configuration for your workspaces

When creating a workspace from the [Create Workspace](https://gitpod.io/new) page, select your repository, editor and workspace class. After that, simply tick the checkbox under the `Continue` button and all subsequent workspaces on this repository will use this same exact configuration.

## FAQs

### How do I reset my autostart configurations?

To clear all of your starting preferences, navigate to your [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/user/preferences) and under `Autostart Options` select `Reset Options`.
