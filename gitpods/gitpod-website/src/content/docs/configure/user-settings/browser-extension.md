# Browser Extension

Creating a workspace is as easy as prefixing any GitHub URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

For convenience, we developed the Gitpod browser extension. It adds a button to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repositories that does the prefixing for you â€“ as simple as that.

We provide the extension for:

-   [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) - also works for Edge, Brave and other Chromium-based browsers.
-   [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/)

## Access the extension settings

You can access the extension settings by clicking on the Gitpod icon in the browser toolbar. In the resulting popup you can find a comprehensive view of all possible customization.

## Use a custom Gitpod instance URL

If you are using a custom Gitpod instance (e.g., [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated)) you can still use the browser extension by configuring it with your instance URL.

After you have installed the extension, open its options and enter your custom Gitpod instance URL.

## Source Code

Gitpod's browser extension is open source. You can check out its [source code](https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-extension), or even open it in Gitpod:
