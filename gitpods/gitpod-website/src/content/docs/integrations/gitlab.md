# GitLab

GitLab can be connected as a Source Code Management (SCM) integration in Gitpod.

## What does the GitLab integration do?

SCM providers are connected to individual user accounts in Gitpod to allow Gitpod to:

1. Pull repository content into workspaces
2. Allow users to commit back to SCM from their workspaces.

## Managing the GitLab integration

### Adding the GitLab integration

1. Navigate to your [User Settings](gitpod.io/user/integrations).
2. Click "connect" on the GitLab integration and follow the steps.

### Modifying permissions for the GitLab integration

Each integration has it's own unique set of scopes (permissions) that the integration is authorized to perform.

1. Navigate to your [User Settings](gitpod.io/user/integrations).
2. Click "edit permissions" on the GitLab integration and follow the steps.

### Removing the GitLab integration
