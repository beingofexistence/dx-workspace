# Bitbucket

Bitbucket can be connected as a Source Code Management (SCM) integration in Gitpod.

## What does the Bitbucket integration do?

SCM providers are connected to individual user accounts in Gitpod to allow Gitpod to:

1. Pull repository content into workspaces
2. Allow users to commit back to SCM from their workspaces.
