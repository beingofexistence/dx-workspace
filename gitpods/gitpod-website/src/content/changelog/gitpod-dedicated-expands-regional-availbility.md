Gitpod Dedicated now supports four additional AWS regions.

**New AWS Regions:**

-   eu-west-2 (London)
-   eu-west-3 (Paris)
-   sa-east-1 (Sao Paulo)
-   us-west-1 (North California)

**Why It Matters:**

These added regions allow for instances to be positioned closer to users, resulting in reduced latency. Additionally, this update allows a broader range of companies to meet data residency requirements that mandate instances and data to be situated in specific regions.
